Logo World - a game for school students, who make first steps in programming. Robot goes in direction of right, left, up and down, makes some teleportation. And the common func is drawing command.
    
So, to run and play with it you need to make some todo.txt file with command in such way:
1. **INIT** \<width> \<height> \<x> \<y>
2. **MOVE** \[**L**|**R**|**U**|**D**] \<steps>
3. **DRAW**
4. **WARD**
5. **TELEPORT** \<x> \<y>

_EXAMPLE OF_ "todo.txt"_:_\
INIT 25 8 0 0 > DRAW > MOVE R 5 > TELEPORT 24 7 > WARD > TELEPORT 0 0
